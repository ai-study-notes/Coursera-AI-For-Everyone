# What is Data?

You may have heard that data is really
important for building AI systems, but what is data really? Let's take a look. Let's look at an example of a table of
data, which we also call a data set. If you're trying to figure out how to
price houses that you're trying to buy or sell, you might collect
a data set like this. And can be just like an Excel
spreadsheet of data, where one column is the size of the house,
say in square feet or square meters, and the second
column is the price of the house. And so, if you're trying to build an AI
system or machine learning system to help you set prices for houses, or figure
out if a house is priced appropriately. You might decide that the size of
the house is A and the price of the house is B, and have an AI system learn this
input to output or A to B mapping. Now, rather than just pricing a house
based on the size, you might say, well, let's also collect data on the number
of bedrooms of this house. In that case,
A can be both of these first two columns, and B can be just the price of the house. So given a table of data,
given a data set, it's actually up to you, up to your business use case to
decide what is A and what is B. Data is often unique to your business. And this is an example of a data
set that a real estate agency might have if they're trying
to help price houses. And it's up to you to decide,
what is A and what is B, and how to choose these definitions of A and
B to make it valuable for your business. As another example,
if you have a certain budget and you want to decide what is
the size of house you can afford, then you might decide that the input
A is how much does someone spend, and B is just the size of
the hulls in square feet. And that would be a totally different
choice of A and B that tells you, given a certain budget, what's the size of
the hulls you should be maybe looking at. Here's another example of a data set. Let's say that you want to build an AI
system to recognize cats in pictures, I'm not sure why you might want to do
that, but maybe the fun mobile app and you want to tag all the pictures of cats. So you might collect a data set where
the input A is set of different images and the output B are labels that says,
first picture is a cat, there's not a cat, there's a cat,
there's not a cat. And have an AI input a picture A and
output B, is it a cat or not? So you can tag all the cat pictures on
your photo feed or on your mobile app. In machine learning tradition, there's actually a lot of
cats in machine learning. I think some of this started when I
was leading the Google Brain team and we published the results with
a somewhat infamous Google cat, where an AI system learned to detect
cats from watching YouTube videos. But since then, there's been a tradition
of using cats as a running example when talking about machine learning. With apologies to all the dog
lovers out there, I love dogs too. So data is important,
but how do you get data? How do you acquire data? Well, one way to get
data is manual labeling. For example, you might collect a set
of pictures like these over here, and then you might either yourself or have
someone else go through these pictures and label each of them. So the first one is a cat, second one
is not a cat, third one is a cat, fourth one is not a cat. And by manually labeling
each of these images, you now have a data set for
building a cat detector. To do that,
you actually need more than four pictures, you might need hundreds
of thousands of pictures. But manual labeling is a tried and true way of getting a data set
where you have both A and B. Another way to get a data set is
from observing user behaviors or other types of behaviors. So, for example, let's say you run
a website that sells things online. So an ecommerce or an electronic commerce
website, where you offer things to users at different prices, and you can just
observe if they buy your product or not. So just through the act of either
buying or not buying your product, you may be able to collect
a data set like this. We can store the user ID, the time
the user visit your website, the price you offer the product to the users, as well
as whether or not they purchased it. And so, just by using your website,
users can generate this data from you. This was an example of
observing user behaviors, we can also observe behaviors of
other things, such as machines. If you run a large machine in a factory,
and you want to predict if a machine is about
to fail or have a fault, then just by observing the behavior of a machine,
you can then record a data set like this. There's a machine ID,
there's the temperature of the machine, there's a pressure within the machine,
and then did the machine fail or not? And if your application
prevents the maintenance, say you want to figure out if
a machine is about to fail. Then you could, for example,
choose this as the input A and choose that as the output B to try to
figure out if a machine is about to fail, in which case, you might do preventative
maintenance on the machine. The third and very common way of acquiring
data is to download it from a website or to get it from a partner. Thanks to the open Internet,
there's just so many data sets that you can download
freely, ranging from computer vision or image data sets, to self-driving car data
sets, to speech recognition data sets, to medical imaging data sets,
to many, many more. And so, if your application needs a type
of data you just download off the web, keeping in mind licensing and copyright, then that could be a great way to
get started on an application. And finally, if you work with a partner,
say you're working with a factory, then they may already have collected a big
data set of machines and temperatures and pressure. And did the machine stay or
not that they could give to you? Data is important, but is also a little
bit overhyped and sometimes misused. Let me describe to you two of
the most common misuses or the bad ways of thinking about data. When I speak with CEOs of large companies,
a few of them have actually said to me, hey, Andrew, give me three years to
build up my IT team, we're collecting so much data. And then after three years,
I'll have this perfect data set and then we'll do AI then,
it turns out that's a really bad strategy. Instead, what I recommend to every company
is, once you started collecting some data, go ahead and start showing it or
feeding it to an AI team. Because often the AI team can give
feedback to your IT team on what types of data to collect and what types of IT
infrastructure to keep on building. For example, maybe an AI team can look
at your factory data and say, hey, you know what? If you can collect data from
this big manufacturing machine, not just once every ten minutes, but
instead once every one minute, then we could do a much better job building a
preventative maintenance systems for you. So there's often this interplay of this
back and forth between IT and AI teams. And my advice is usually, try to get
feedback from AI earlier because it can help you guide the development
of your IT infrastructure. Second, misuse of data. Unfortunately, I've seen some CEOs read
about the importance of data in the news and then say, hey, I have so much data,
surely an AI team can make it valuable. And unfortunately,
this doesn't always work out. More data is usually better than less
data, but I wouldn't take it for granted just because you
have many terabytes or gigabytes of data that an AI team
can magically make that valuable. So my advice is, don't throw data in
AI team and assume it will be valuable. In fact, in one extreme case,
I saw one company go and acquire a whole string of other
companies in medicine on the thesis on the hypothesis that their
data would be very valuable. And now, a couple of years later, as far
as I know, the engineers have not yet figured out how to take all this data and
actually create value out of it. So sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't, but I would not over invest in
just acquiring data for the sake of data until unless you also
get an AI team to take a look at it. Because they can help guide you to think
through what is the data that is actually the most valuable. Finally, data is messy, you may have
heard the phrase garbage in, garbage out. And if you have bad data,
then the AI will learn inaccurate things. Here are some examples of data problems. Let's say you have this data set of
sizes of houses, number of bedrooms, and the price, you can have incorrect
labels or just incorrect data. For example, this house is
probably not going to sell for $0.001 thousand, just for $1. Or data can also have missing values,
such as, we have here, a whole bunch of unknown values. And so, your AI team will need to
figure out how to clean up the data, or how to deal with these incorrect
labels and or missing values. And there are also multiple types of data,
for example, sometimes you hear about images,
audio, and text. These are types of data that humans
find it very easy to interpret. There's a term for this,
this is called unstructured data. And there's certain types of AI techniques
that could work with images to recognize cats, or audio to recognize speech, or
text to understand if an email is spam. And then there are also data
sets like the one on the right. This is an example of structured data, and that basically means data that
lives in a giant spreadsheet. And the techniques for dealing with
unstructured data are a little bit different than the techniques for
dealing with structured data. Germs of AI today is used primarily
to generate unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio,
rather than structured data. In contrast,
supervised learning can work very well for both of these types of data,
unstructured data and structured data. In this video,
you learned what is data, and you also saw how not to misuse data,
for example, by overinvesting in an IT infrastructure in the hope that
it will be useful for AI in the future. But without actually checking
that it really will be useful for the AI applications you want to build. And finally, you saw data is messy, but a good AI team will be able to help
you deal with all of these problems. Now, AI has a complicated terminology
where people throw around terms like AI, machine learning, data science. What I want to do in the next video is
share with you what these terms actually mean, so
that you'll be able to confidently and accurately talk about these
concepts with others. Let's go on to the next video.
