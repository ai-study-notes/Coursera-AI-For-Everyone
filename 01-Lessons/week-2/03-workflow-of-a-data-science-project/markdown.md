# Workflow Of A Data Science Project

Unlike a machine
learning project, the output of a data
science project is often a set of
actionable insights, a set of insights that may cause you to do things differently. So, data science projects have a different workflow than
machine learning projects. Let's take a look
at one of the steps of a data science project. As our running example, let's say you want to
optimize a sales funnel. Say you run an e-commerce or an online shopping
website that sells coffee mugs and so for a user to buy
a coffee mug from you, there's a sequence of steps
they'll usually follow. First, they'll visit
your website and take a look at the different coffee mugs
on offer, then eventually, they have to get
to a product page, and then they'll have to put
it into their shopping cart, and go to the shopping cart page, and then they'll finally
have to check out. So, if you want to optimize
the sales funnel to make sure that as many people as possible get through
all of these steps, how can you use data science
to help with this problem? Let's look at the key steps
of a data science project. The first step is
to collect data. So, on a website
like the one we saw, you may have a data
set that stores when different users go to
different web pages. In this simple example, I'm assuming that
you can figure out the country that the users
are coming from, for example, by looking at
their computers' address, called an IP address, and figuring out
what is the country from which they're originating. But in practice,
you can usually get quite a bit more data about users than just what
country they're from. The second step is to
then analyze the data. Your data science team may
have a lot of ideas about what is affecting the performance
of your sales funnel. For example, they may think that overseas customers
are scared off by the international shipping costs which is why a lot
of people go to the checkout page but
don't actually check out. If that's true then
you might think about whether to put
part of shipping costs into the actual product costs
,or your data science team may think there are blips in the data whenever
there's a holiday. Maybe more people
will shop around the holidays because
they're buying gifts or maybe fewer people will shop around the holidays
because they're staying home rather than sometimes shopping from
their work computers. In some countries, there
may be time-of-day blips wherein countries
that observe a siesta, so a time of rest like
an afternoon rest, there may be fewer shoppers online and so
your sales may go down. They may then suggest
that you should spend fewer advertising dollars during the period of siesta because fewer people will go online
to buy at that time. So, a good data science team may have many ideas and so they try many ideas or will say iterate many times to get good insights. Finally, the data science team will distill these insights down to a smaller number
of hypotheses about ideas of what could be going well and what
could be going poorly as well as a smaller number
of suggested actions such as incorporating shipping costs
into the product costs rather than having it
as a separate line item. When you take some of
these suggested actions and deploy these changes
to your website, you then start to get new data back as users behave
differently now that you advertise
differently at the time of siesta or have a different
check-out policy. Then your data science team
can continue to collect data and we analyze the new data periodically to see if
they can come up with even better hypotheses or
even better actions over time. So the key steps of
a data science project are to collect the data, to analyze the data, and then to suggest
hypotheses and actions, and then to continue
to get the data back and reanalyze the data
periodically. Let's take this framework and
apply it to a new problem, to optimizing a
manufacturing line. So we'll take these three steps and use them on
the next slide as well. Let's say you run
a factory that's manufacturing thousands
of coffee mugs a month for sale and you want to optimize the manufacturing line. So, these are the key steps
in manufacturing coffee mugs. Step one is to mix the clay, so make sure the appropriate
amount of water is added. Step two is to take this clay
and to shape the mugs. Then you have to add the glaze, so add the coloring,
a protective cover. Then you have to heat this mug and we call
that firing the kiln. Finally, you would inspect the mug to make sure there aren't dents in the mug and it isn't cracked before you
ship it to customers. So, a common problem
in manufacturing is to optimize the yield of
this manufacturing line to make sure that as few damaged
coffee mugs get produced as possible because those are coffee mugs you
have to throw away, resulting in time
and material waste. What's the first step of
a data science project? I hope you remember from
the last slide that the first step is
to collect data. So for example, you
may save data about the different batches of
clay that you've mixed, such as who supplied the clay and how
long did you mix it, or maybe how much moisture
was in the clay, how much water did you add. You might also collect data about the different batches
of mugs you made. So how much humidity
was in that batch? What was the temperature
in the kiln and how long did you
fire it in the kiln? Given all this data
you would then ask the data science team to analyze
the data and they would, as before, iterate many times
to get good insights. So, they may find
that, for example, that whenever the humidity is too low and the kiln
temperature is too hot that there are cracks in
the mug or they may find out that because
it's warmer in the afternoon that
you need to adjust the humidity and temperature depending on the time of day. Based on the insights from your data science team you get
suggestions for hypotheses and actions on how to
change the operations and manufacturing line in order to improve the productivity
of the line. When you deploy the changes, you then get new data back that you can reanalyze
periodically so they can keep on optimizing the performance of
your manufacturing line. To summarize, the key steps of a data science project
are to collect the data, to analyze the data, and then to suggest
hypotheses and actions. In this video and the last video
you saw some examples of machine learning projects
and data science projects. It turns out that machine
learning and data science are affecting almost every
single job function. What I want to do in
the next video is show you how these ideas are affecting
many job functions, including perhaps yours and certainly that of many
of your colleagues. Let's go on to the next video.
