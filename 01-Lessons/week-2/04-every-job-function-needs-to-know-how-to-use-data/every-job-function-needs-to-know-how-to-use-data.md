# Every Job Function Needs To Know How To Use Data

Data is transforming
many different job functions, whether you work in
recruiting or sales or marketing or manufacturing
or agriculture, data is probably transforming
your job function. What's happened in
the last few decades is the digitization
of our society. So, rather than handing out
papers surveys like these, surveys are more
likely to be done in digital format, or doctors still write
some handwritten notes , but doctors handwritten note
is increasingly likely to be a digital record and so to this in just about every
single job function. This availability
of data means that there's a good chance
that your job function could be helped with tools like data science or machine
learning. Let's take a look. In this video, I
want to run through many different job functions
and discuss how data science and
machine learning can or will impact these
different types of jobs. Let's start with sales. You've already seen
in the last video how data science can be used to
optimize a sales funnel. How about machine learning? If you're a salesperson
you may have a set of leads about
different people that you could reach out to to convince them to buy
something from your company. Machine learning can help
you prioritize these leads. So, you might want to prioritize calling up the CEO of
a large company rather than the intern at a much smaller
company and this type of automated leads sorting is making salespeople
more efficient. Let's look at more examples. Let say you're a
manufacturing line manager. You've already seen
how data science can help you optimize
a manufacturing line. How about machine learning? One of the steps of this manufacturing process
is the final inspection. In fact today, in many factories there can
be hundreds or thousands of people using the human eye
to check over objects, maybe coffee mugs, maybe other
things to see if they're scratches or dents and
that's called inspection. So, machine learning
can take this input, a dataset like this, and learn to automatically figure out if a coffee mug
is defective or not. By automatically finding
scratches or dents, it can reduce labor costs and also improve quality
in your factory. This type of automated
visual inspection is one of the technologies that
I think will have a big impact on manufacturing. This is something I've been
working on myself as well. Let's see more examples. How about recruiting? When recruiting someone
to join your company, there may be a pretty
predictable sequence of steps where your recruiter or someone else would
send an email to a candidate and then you'd
have a phone call with them, bring them on-site
for an interview and then extend an offer and
maybe close the offer. Similar to how
data science can be used to optimize a sales funnel, recruiting can also use
data science to optimize a recruiting funnel and in fact many recruiting organizations
are doing so today. For example, if you
find that hardly anyone is making it from
the phone screen step to the on-site interviews
step then you may conclude that maybe
too many people are getting into the phone screen
stage or maybe the people doing
the phone screen are just being too tough
and you should let more people get to
the onsite interview stage. This type of
data science is already having an impact on recruiting. What about machine
learning projects? Well, one of the steps
of recruiting is to screen a lot of resumes to decide who to reach out to. So, you may have to look at
one resume and say, "Yes, let's email them", look at
a different one to say, "No, let us not move ahead
with this candidate." Machine learning is
starting to make its way into automated resume screening. Does raise important
ethical questions such as making sure that your AI software does not exhibit undesirable forms of bias
and treats people fairly, but machine learning
is starting to make inroads into this and I hope can do so while making sure that the systems are ethical and fair. In the final week of this
AI For Everyone course, you'll also learn
more about the issues of fairness and ethics in AI. What if you work in marketing? One of the common ways
to optimize the performance in a website
is called AB testing, in which you launch
two versions of website. Here version A has a red button, version B has a green button
and you measure which websites causes people
to click through more. So with this type of data, a data science team can
help you gain insights and suggests hypotheses or actions for optimizing your website. How about machine learning
and marketing? Today a lot of websites will give customized product
recommendations to show you the things you're most likely
to want to buy and this actually significantly increases
sales on these websites. For example, a clothing website after seeing the way
I shop after while, will hopefully just recommend blue shirts to me because that's frankly pretty much
the only type shirt I ever buy, but maybe other
customers will have more diverse and more interesting
recommendations than mine. But today these customized product recommendations
actually drive a large percentage of sales on many large online
e-commerce websites. One last example from
a totally different sector. Let's say you work
in agriculture. Maybe you're a farmer working on the light industrial farm, how can data science help you? Today farmers are already using data science for crop analytics, where you can take data on the soil conditions,
the weather conditions, the presence of different crops
in the market and have data science teams make
recommendations to what to plant, when to plant so
as to improve use while maintaining the condition
of the soil on your farm. This type of
data science is and will play a bigger and bigger role
in agriculture. Let's also look at
the machine learning example. I think one of
the most exciting changes to agriculture is
precision agriculture. Here's a picture that I took on a farm with my cell phone. On the upper right is a cotton plant and shown
in the middle is a weed. With machine learning,
we're starting to see products that
can go onto the farms, take a picture like
this and spray a weed killer in
a very precise way just onto the weeds so that it gets rid of the weed but without having to spray an excessive
amount of weed killers. This type of machine learning technology is both
helping farmers increase crop yields while also helping to preserve
the environment. In this video, you saw how all of these job functions,
everything from sales, recruiting to marketing to manufacturing to
farming agriculture, how all of these job functions are being affected by data, by data science and
machine learning. It seems like there's a lot of different things you
could do with AI. But how do you actually select a promising
project to work on? Let's talk about that
in the next video.
