# How To Choose An AI Project Part-1

If you want to try your
hand at an AI project, how do you select a worthwhile
project to work on? Don't expect an idea to
[inaudible] come overnight. Sometimes it happens,
but sometimes it also takes a few days, or maybe a few weeks, to come up with a worthy idea to pursue. In this video, you see a
framework for brainstorming, potentially exciting
AI projects to pursue. Let's say you want to build an AI project for your business. You've already seen that
AI can't do everything, and so there's going
to be a certain set of things that is what AI can do. Let's let this circle represent the set of things
that AI can do. Now, there's also going
to be a certain set of things that is valuable
for your business, so let's let this second circle represent a set of things that are valuable
for your business. What you would like to do
is try to select projects that are at the intersection
of these two sets, so you select projects, hopefully, that
are both feasible, that can be done with AI, and that are also valuable
for your business. AI experts will tend to have a good sense of what is and what isn't in the
set on the left, and domain experts, experts in your business, maybe sales and marketing,
or agriculture, or something else,
will have a best sense of what is actually
valuable for your business. When brainstorming projects that AI can do and are valid
for your business, I will often bring together a team comprising both people, knowledgeable of AI, as well as experts in your business area to
brainstorm together, so that together they
can try to identify projects at the intersection
of both of these two sets. Sometimes we also call these
cross-functional teams, and that just means
a team that includes both AI experts as well
as domain experts, meaning experts in
your area of business. When brainstorming projects,
there's a framework that I've used with a lot of companies that I've
found to be useful. Let me share with you
three principles of three ideas for how you can have a team brainstorm projects. First, even though
there's been a lot of press coverage about AI
automating jobs away, and this is an important
societal issue that needs to be addressed, when thinking about
concrete AI projects, I find it much more useful
to think about automating tasks rather than
automating jobs. Take call center operations, there are a lot of tasks that
happen in the call center, ranging from people
picking up the phone, to answering phone calls, to replying to emails, to taking specific actions, such as issuing a refund on
behalf of a customer request. But of all of these tasks that employees in
the call center do, there may be one call routing or email routing that
may be politically amenable to a machine
learning automation. It's by looking at
all these tasks that the group of employees
do and selecting one that may allow you to select the most fruitful project for automation in the near term. Let's look at another example, the job of radiologists. There's been a lot
of press about how AI may automate
radiologists'[ jobs, but radiologists actually
do a lot of things. They read X-rays, that's really important, but they also engage in their
own continuing education. They consult with other doctors, they may mentor younger doctors, some of them also consult
directly with patients. It's by looking at all
of these tasks that a radiologist does that you
may identify one of them, let's say AI assistance or AI automation for
reading X-rays, that allows you to select the most fruitful
projects to work on. So what I would recommend is if you look at your business, think about the
tasks that people do to see if you can
identify just one of them or just a
couple of them that may be automatable using
machine learning. When I'm meeting CEOs of large companies to brainstorm
AI projects by the company, a common question
I'll also ask is, what are the main drivers
of business value? Sometimes finding
AI solutions or data science solutions to augment this can
be very valuable. Finally, a third question
that I've asked is, sometimes led to valuable
project ideas is, what are the main pain
points in your business? Some of them could
be solved with AI, some of them can't
be solved with AI, but by understanding the main pain points
in the business, that can create a
useful starting point for brainstorming AI
projects as well. I have one last piece of advice for brainstorming
AI projects, which is that you can make progress even without big data, even without tons of data. Now, don't get me wrong, having more data almost never hurts, other than maybe needing
to pay a bit more for disk space or network bandwidth to transmit
and store the data. Having more data almost
always is only helpful, and I love having lots of data. It is also true that data makes some businesses like
web search defensible. Web search is a
long-tail business, meaning that there are a lot
of very rare web queries, and so seeing what people
click on when they search on all of these rare
web queries does help. The leading web
search engines have a much better search experience. Big data is great
when you can get it, but I think big data is
also sometimes over-hyped. Even with a small dataset, you can still often make
progress. Here's an example. Let's say you're building a automated visual inspection
system for the coffee mug. So you want to
automatically detect that the coffee mug on the
right is defective. Well, if you had a
million pictures of good coffee mugs and
defective coffee mugs, it'd be great to have
that many examples of pictures of good
and bad coffee mugs to feed your AI system. But I hope that you
have not manufactured a million defective coffee
mugs because that feels like a very expensive thing
to have to throw away. Sometimes with as
few as 100 pictures, or maybe 1,000, or sometimes maybe as few as 10, you may be able to get started on a machine learning project. The amount of data you need is very problem-dependent
and speaking with a AI engineer or an AI expert would help
you get a better sense. There are some problems where 1,000 images may not be enough, where you do need big data
to get good performance. But my advice is, don't give up just
because you don't have a lot of data
to start off with, and you can often still make progress even with
a small dataset. In this video, you saw a brainstorming
framework and a set of criteria for
trying to come up with projects that
hopefully can be doable with AI and that are also
valuable for your business. Now, having brainstormed
[inaudible] projects, how do you select one or select a small handful to actually
commit to and work on? Let's talk about that
in the next video.
