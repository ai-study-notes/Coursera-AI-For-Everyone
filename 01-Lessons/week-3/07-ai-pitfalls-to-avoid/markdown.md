# AI Pitfalls To Avoid

I hope you'll be
able to use AI to build exciting and
valuable projects, either for yourself
or for your company, and make life better, both for yourself
and for others. Along the way, I hope you
also managed to avoid some of the pitfalls that I've seen
some AI teams fall into. Let's go over five dots and do if you're trying to
build AI for your company. First one, don't expect
AI to solve everything. You already know that
AI can do a lot, but there's also a lot
that AI cannot do. Instead, you should
be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technology, data, and engineering resources. That's why I think
technical diligence, in addition to
business diligence, is important for selecting feasible and valuable
AI projects. Second, don't just hire two or three machine
learning engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
for your company. Machine learning engineers
are a scarce resource, but you should instead pair
the engineering talent with business talent and work cross functionally to find feasible
and valuable projects. It is often the combination of the machine learning talent with the business talent
that can select the most valuable and
feasible projects. Third, don't expect the AI project to
work the first time. As you've already seen, AI development is often an iterative process
so you should plan for it through an
iterative process with multiple attempts
needed to succeed. Fourth, don't expect
traditional planning processes to apply without changes. Instead, you should work with the AI team to establish
timeline estimates, milestones, KPIs, or
metrics that do make sense. The types of timeline
estimates, milestones, and KPIs or metrics associated
with AI projects are a bit different than the same things associated
with non-AI projects. Hopefully, working with some individuals'
knowledge about AI can help you come up with better ways of
planning AI projects. Finally, don't think you need superstar AI engineers
before you can do anything. Instead, keep
building the team and get going with the
team you have, realizing that there are many AI engineers
in the world today, including many that have learned primarily from online courses, that can do a great job building valuable and
feasible projects. If you can avoid
these AI pitfalls, you'll already be
ahead of the game compared to many
other companies. The important thing
is to get started. Your second AI project would
be better than your first. Your third AI project would
be better than your second. The important thing
is to get started, enter attempt your
first AI project. In the final video
for this week, I want to share with you
some concrete first steps you can take in AI. Let's go on to the next video.
