# AI And Developing Economies

Every time there's a major technological
disruption, such as with AI, it gives us a chance to remake the world. AI is a very advanced technology, yes, affecting both developed economies and
developing economies. So how can we make sure that even
as AI creates tremendous wealth, that it uplifts all nations? Let's take a look. There's been a fairly predictable roadmap,
almost a ladder, that many developing economies have
successfully executed in order to help the citizens gain skills and
climb to higher levels of wealth. A lot of nations started off with
lower-end agricultural products, exporting crops, and then moved
to low-end textile manufacturing, such as clothing manufacturing. And then as the population starts
to gain a bit more wealth, become a bit more healthy, move on
to low-end components manufacturing, such as making less
expensive plastic parts. To then moving on to low-end electronics
manufacturing, to higher-end electronics manufacturing, maybe to
automotive manufacturing, and so on. And there's been this step-by-step
progression by which developing economies can help their citizens gain
skill and become developed economies. One of the problems that AI could cause
is that, a lot of the lower rungs on the ladder are particularly
susceptible to automation through AI. For example,
as factories become more automated, or as agriculture becomes more automated,
there may be less need. And therefore less opportunities for large members of a population of some of
these developing economies, to get onto the lower rungs of this economic ladder
from which they would then climb up. So if we're knocking out some of
the lower rungs of the ladder through AI, through AI providing
automation on steroids, then it is incumbent on us to see
if AI can also create a trampoline. To help some developed economies
jump onto the trampoline and bounce, maybe even more quickly,
to the higher rungs of this ladder. With the rise of earlier
ways of technology, many economies have shown that they
can leapfrog developed economies, and jump straight to a more
advanced technology. For example, here in the United States,
most of us had landlines, phones that were connected
via wire to the wall. And because so
many of us had landline phones, that actually took a while to
transition to wireless mobile phones. In contrast, many developing economies,
including India and China, but many others as well, didn't bother to
build nearly as many landlines, but skipped straight to mobile phones. So this was a leapfrog where developing
economies jumped straight over the earlier generation of technology. And didn't bother to lay so many physical
cables to every person's homes, and instead jumped straight to mobile phones. We're seeing a similar
thing with mobile payments, where many developed economies have
a mature credit card system, and that actually is slowing down their
adoption of mobile or cell phone payments. Compared to some developing economies
which do not already have entrenched incumbents in the credit card industry. I'm also seeing rapid adoption of online
education in developing economies. In countries that have not yet built
all the many, many physical schools and universities that they need,
many educational leaders and governments are seeking ways to more
quickly embrace online education. Compared to some of the developed
economies that have this built up physical infrastructure for
in person education. While developed economies are also rapidly
embracing all of these technologies, one of the advantages of developing
economies is that without an entrenched incumbent system, perhaps there are areas
that they could build even faster. The United States, particularly when it
comes to generative AI, is in the lead. Close behind is China,
which also has tremendous AI talent, and the UK, Canada, India, Korea,
many places in Latin America, and many other countries also
have vibrant AI communities. But we're still in the early
development of AI, so I think every country still has a lot of
opportunities and a lot of growth ahead. My advice to developing economies
is to focus on AI to strengthen a country's vertical industries. For example, I think most countries today should not
try to build their own web search engine. There are already great
web search engines, and that was last decade's competition. Instead, if a country has a very
strong vertical industry in, say, coffee bean manufacturing,
then that country is actually uniquely qualified to do work in AI for
coffee manufacturing. And building AI for coffee manufacturing
would even further strengthen what that country is already good at. So rather than needing for every country to compete with the US and
China on AI in general, I would advise most countries to use AI to
strengthen what that country is good at. Or what that country wants
to do in the future. Finally, public private partnerships,
meaning governments and corporations working together, can really help accelerate a vertical
industry's AI developments. In highly regulated sectors ranging
from healthcare to transportation like self-driving cars, to finance, there
are certain outcomes that we want and certain outcomes that we don't want. And governments that are thoughtful
about drafting the right regulations to protect citizens. While at the same time enabling
the adoption of AI solutions to these industries, will see faster
local economic growth, as well as faster technology
development within their country. Finally, developing economies
should invest in education, because AI is still so immature. There's still plenty of room for
every nation to learn more about AI, maybe even build up its own AI workforce,
and participate in a significant way in this
AI-powered world that we're building. In moments of technological disruption,
leadership matters. Here in the United States, we once trusted our government to put
a man on the moon, and it worked. With the rise of AI, it creates a space,
and in some countries a need for leadership, whether at government
levels or in companies or in education. To help a country enter the AI era and
embrace and adopt AI to keep on lifting up its citizens, and perhaps even keep
on lifting up other people worldwide. In this video, we've touched briefly
on the issue of AI and jobs. This is an important topic that is widely
discussed in many countries right now. Let's go on to the next video to
take a deeper look at AI and jobs.
