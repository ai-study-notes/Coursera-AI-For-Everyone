# Conclusion

Congratulations on coming to
the last video of this course. AI is a superpower and understanding it allows you to do things
that very few people on the planet can. Let's summarize what you've
seen in this course. In the first week, you learned
about AI technology, what is AI and what is machine learning? What's supervised learning,
that is learning inputs, outputs, or A to B mappings. As well as what is data science, and how
data feeds into all of these technologies? Importantly, you also saw examples
of what AI can and cannot do. In the second week, you learned what
it feels like to build an AI project. You saw the workflow of machine learning
projects, of collecting data, building a system, and deploying it, as well as
the workflow of data science projects. And you also learned about carrying
out technical diligence to make sure a project is feasible, together with
business diligence to make sure that the project is valuable before you commit
to taking on a specific AI project. In the third week, you learned how such AI projects could
fit in the context of your company. You saw examples of complex AI products,
such as a smart speaker, a self-driving car, the roles and
responsibilities of large AI teams. And you also saw the AI transformation
playbook, the five-step playbook for helping a company become
a great AI company. I hope these materials throughout
these first three weeks can help you brainstorm AI projects or think about how you might want to use AI
in your company or in your organization. In this week, week four,
you learned about AI and society. You saw some of the limitations of AI
beyond just technical limitations, and also learned about how AI is affecting
developing economies and jobs worldwide. You've learned a lot in these four weeks,
but AI is a complex topic. So I hope you will keep on learning, whether through additional online courses,
through Coursera or deeplearning.ai, or books, or blogs,
or just by talking to friends. If you ever want to try your
hand at building AI technology, it is now easier than
ever to learn to code and learn how to implement AI
technology through these resources. If you'd like to keep on
receiving information about AI, you can also sign up for
the deeplearning.ai mailing list, by going to the deeplearning.ai
website and signing up there. I'll occasionally send you
useful information about AI through that mailing list. Congratulations on finishing this course. You're now significantly ahead
of many large companies' CEOs in your understanding of AI and
your ability to plan for the rise of AI. So I hope that you provide
leadership to others as well that are trying to navigate these issues. Lastly, I want to say to you, thank
you very much for taking this course. I know that you're busy with your own
work or school, and friends and family, and I'm grateful that you spend so much
time with me and in this course learning these complex issues relating to both
the technology and the impact of AI. So thank you very much for both the time
and the effort you put Into this course.
