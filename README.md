## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific lesson or module.  
Inside each lesson folder, you'll typically find:

- `lecture.pdf` → Lecture slides or PDFs.
- `notes.md` → Personal notes or transcript summaries.
- `code.ipynb` → Code used or explained in the lecture.

There are also:

- `/Assets/` → Visuals used in lectures or summaries.
- `/Quizzes/` → Questions & answers after each section.
- `/Projects/` → Projects done during the course.
- `/Resources/` → External reading, books, helpful links.
